![about_me](/images/about_me_low.png){: .align_right width="300px"}
🐧 I am a postdoctoral researcher at NIST. 

🏢 I work in fire safety engineering.

🫥 My research interests include the application of AI and machine learning (AI/ML) in firefighting and building evacuation, assessment of emerging fire risks, and building facility management.

🏫 I received my PhD from the City University of Hong Kong in 2023.

🏸 During my leisure time, I enjoy playing badminton, going on sightseeing tours, and visiting museums and zoos.
